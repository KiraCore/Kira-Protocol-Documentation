>  Interchain Registrar

Goal of this proposal is to implement a multi-directional peg-contract enabling token transfers and communication between uncapped number of decentralized networks.

_NOTE: Pegging in simple words is a mechanism of locking assets assets on chain `A` in order to issue them on chain the `B` and vice versa._

## Implementation

#### Main Objectives
* `chain-id` and `controller` Accounts Registrar
* Bidirectional Value Transfers
  * ERC20
