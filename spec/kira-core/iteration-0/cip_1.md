# CIP_1
> Create Kira Core Landing Page

Kira Core requires a main landing page, a static website (which can be hosted directly from the [github pages](https://pages.github.com/)). Website should serve a purpose of informing users about Kira Core products and services through an engaging visual format. Website should be accessible and pleasing to view in both PC and mobile format.

Website should be minimalistic/modern, without any sort of a typical ICO of Cryptocurrencies page feel. There should be no "rockets" or any other similar symbols present.

Colours should match [Kira Core logo](../img/kira-core.png) and be light, fitting Japanese minimalism style.

#### Features
*  Almost infinitely scalable order books
*  Supports trading of staking derivatives
*  Greater legal compliance and user security
*  Allows operating private DEX zones that anyone can trust

### MBPoS Consensus
* Description - The Multi-Bonded Proof of Stake (MBPoS) is powered by [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/) and belongs to the family of the Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus systems. MBPoS enables users to generate revenues from staking both cryptocurrencies and real-world assets such as fiat and commodities.

#### Features
* Earn revenue by staking real world assets
* Maintain liquidity and trade all assets at stake
* Use derivatives to stake on leverage
* Maintain unprecedented security


### IDO Crowdfunding
*  Description - The Initial Delegator Offering (IDO) is a crowdfunding mechanism where investors place their existing tokens or assets at stake using one or many PoS networks to “interchain-mine” a new token instead of liquidating their valuable assets to acquire new, highly speculative tokens. Kira Core provides staking services and all necessary tools enabling you to raise funds for your new startup!

#### Features

* Keep full custody over 100% of your investment with the ability to pull out at any time

* Mitigate volatility risk, by not having to exchange any of your existing assets for tokens
* Invest with a negligible risk exposure while enabling new startups to profit and innovate
