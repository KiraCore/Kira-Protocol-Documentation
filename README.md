Kira Protocol and improvements to Bonded/Nominated Proof of Stake consensus mechanism in the form of the Multi-Bonded Proof of Stake as well as other Kira Core inventions are released under the MIT license with exception for the Initial Delegator Offerings.

Initial Delegator Offering is an invention and intellectual property of Kira Core JSC, released under the Affero General Public License, version 3 (AGPL). Modifying the Initial Delegator Offering (IDO) (for example, creating a new blockchain or off-chain offering software), reimplementations, use in other software, or otherwise create a new work based on any work related to Initial Delegator Offering materials licensed under the AGPL, your software will be automatically licensed under the AGPL and needs to be made available to everyone who is a recipient of your new or modified software or interacts with it remotely over a network. 

You must inform your users that the source code is available and acknowledge Kira Core JSC as intellectual property owner. You need to prominently include a distinct and highly visible [Kira Core Logo](https://github.com/KiraCore/Kira-Protocol-Documentation/blob/master/KIRA-CORE-LOGO.png) and "[download source](https://github.com/KiraCore/Kira-Protocol-Documentation)" button or link on your website, such as where programs are downloaded, and in the user interface of any software that interacts with your modified code. The "download source" button must allow anyone to directly download the exact source code and applicable cryptographic keys needed to install or use the modified AGPL software.

If you would prefer different licensing terms, Kira Core JSC offers commercial licensing options. For more information, contact us at partners@kiracore.com
