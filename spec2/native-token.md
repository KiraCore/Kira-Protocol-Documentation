# Kira Protocol Token

`KEX` is a native token of the Kira Protocol. By design Kira's native token is an inflationary utility token (created each block), but might capped depending on the future network consensus and its established position in the ecosystem.

The base denomination of the `KEX` token is `ukex` (micro KEX) and equals `1^-6` KEX, or in other words `1 KEX` == `1'000'000 ukex`

The total initial supply or `KEX` tokens created in the genesis file will be equal to `c`, that is `299 792 458 KEX`. 

Initially all tokens will be credited into account of the `Kira Foundation` from where **minimum** of `51%` will be distributed though the process of **interchain mining** aka [Initial Delegator Offering (IDO)](https://github.com/KiraCore/Kira-Protocol-Documentation/blob/master/Kira-Protocol-Whitepaper.pdf). At the end of the distribution process `Kira Foundation` is expected to maintain no more than `30%` of all `KEX` tokens from which **minimum** of `20%` will be permanently staked for the purpose of incentivising network operators while the remaining, maximum of `10%` for the purpose of community incentivization through grants, bounties, testnets, audits and bug-hunt events.
